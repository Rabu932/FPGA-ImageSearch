## 1. OVERVIEW

This project describes the implementation of the super sample rate (SSR) filter â€“ where the sample data rate is greater than the clock rate using Vivado HLS tool.

The goal specification for this filter:
* The effective data rate = 1.6 Gsps (= 4 * clock rate) 
* 128 tap symmetric coefficients
* Clock rate = 400 MHz

## 2. SOFTWARE TOOLS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Any Vivado HLS release from 2014.1 to 2016.1
