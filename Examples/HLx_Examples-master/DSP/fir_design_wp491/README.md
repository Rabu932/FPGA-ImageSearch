The HLS based FIR Filter and associated scripts enables the generation 2 variants of the FIR Filter HLS project. 
One with 32-bit Single Precision Floating Point data-types and one with Fixed Point data-types. This allows the 
user to easily incorporate these 2 designs into the System Generator for DSP model included and perform a simple 
comparison of the 2 FIR designs. Evaluating resources, power and accuracy.
